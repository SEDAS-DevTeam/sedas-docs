About
===================================

This project is a new concept of an ATC simulator both for beginners and advanced users. 
It utilises neural networks and implements custom AI module to imitate real pilots (e. g. pseudopilots in the terms of ATC simulation). 
Goal of this desktop application is to make ATC learning easier for hobbyists and begineer ATC students, 
so that they don't need specialized hardware and software for the subject of Air traffic control (ATC).

.. note::

   **This project is still under active development.** The project itself is quite complex and requires some parts to be reimplemented for the upcoming versions.


Redirects
===================================

If you want to get to specific parts/explanation to the project, you can click on any record in the table of contents (ToC) for a redirect to specific part of documentation.
ToC is structured into this format:

* **User manual** - Manual for the SEDAS user. Describes the whole app pipeline and explains every functionality that is currently implemented
* **ATC theory** - A small sub-documentation that explains Air traffic control (ATC) in simpler terms than in official docs, also redirects to other documentations (Skybrary, IVAO, etc.) 
* **Technical background** - Explains every feature and the whole architecture of SEDAS in technical terms. Mostly for people who want to contribute to SEDAS.
