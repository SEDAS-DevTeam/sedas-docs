About
===================================

This project is a new concept of an ATC simulator both for beginners and advanced users. 
It utilises neural networks and implements custom AI module to imitate real pilots (i. e. pseudopilots in the terms of ATC simulation). 
Goal of this desktop application is to make ATC learning easier for hobbyists and beginner ATC students, 
so that they don't need specialized hardware and software for the subject of Air traffic control (ATC).

.. note::

   **This project is still under active development.** The project itself is quite complex and requires some parts to be reimplemented for the upcoming versions.

The project itself is divided into several subprojects that are under the **SEDAS-DevTeam** organisation on github (`link <https://github.com/SEDAS-DevTeam>`_).
The goal of this project is to educate more people about the air traffic control. Therefore that is the reason why the whole codebase is fully opensource and is ready for any contributions
to the project in the means of creating sustainable ATC community. In the future, this project will contain even more active repositories to contribute to the ATC research and development. 

Redirects
===================================

If you want to get to specific parts/explanation to the project, you can click on any record in the table of contents (ToC) for a redirect to specific part of documentation.
ToC is structured into this format:

* **User manual** - Manual for the SEDAS user. Describes the whole app pipeline and explains every functionality that is currently implemented
* **ATC theory** - A small sub-documentation that explains Air traffic control (ATC) in simpler terms than in official docs, also redirects to other documentations (Skybrary, IVAO, etc.) 
* **Technical background** - Explains every feature and the whole architecture of SEDAS in technical terms. Mostly for people who want to contribute to SEDAS.
